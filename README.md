Task Description : Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation.  You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or  applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel.  Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

According to what was possible to do by me, I created a program in python with tkinter gui incorporating the Arnold Cat Map Method for encrypting the images by shuffling the pixels around. 

Screenshots of code and output are also present in the repo for a preview.
